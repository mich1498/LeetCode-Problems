# LeetCode-Problems
This repository is for myself, just to keep track of my progress and a quick go to place, if you do stumble upon this (highly unlikely) i wish you all the best with your leetcode prep too :P 
These are all the leetcode problems I have solved,(hence many of them will not be optimal solutions, but i am still learning) , my goal is to solve 300 problems this year
Most of the code is written in c++, but occassionally i write in python too. 
I also plan on learning swift sometiem this year and will resolve all these problems in swift :D 

Btw this is still work in progress, i am yet to transfer my code from leetcode to this repository. 
A quick link to my leetcode profile can be found [here](https://leetcode.com/mike1498/), it's kinda embarrassing now so please don't check it :( (Pinky promise?)
