# LeetCode-Problems
This repository is for myself, just to keep track of my progress and a quick go to place, if you do stumble upon this (highly unlikely) i wish you all the best with your leetcode prep too :P 
These are all the leetcode problems I have solved , my goal is to solve 300 problems this year. 
Most of the code is written in c++, but occassionally i write in python too. 
I also plan on learning swift sometiem this year and will resolve all these problems in swift :D
